# Spring Boot Ice Cream Store

### What is this project?
This project is a blueprint of an Spring Boot 3.0 application. Is configured with Hibernate, Docker and a postgreSQL database that runs in a container.

### How to run it?
You can run the Spring Boot app as always. If you want to run the postgreSQL database. You can use:
```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Why?
I want to quickly start creating Spring Boot APIs and don't waste time pre-configuring stuff.
This project acts as quickstart as the options previously mentioned are already pre-configured, you may use it as you like.
